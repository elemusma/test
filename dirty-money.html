Volkswagen Defeat Device:
</h2>
<p>
Volkswagen had created a device that would fool emissions test. The purpose was to become the #1 Car Company in the world - at any cost. The software engineers created the device with the permission of the owners.
</p>
<p>
The device's purpose was to trick the testers by expelling less pollution into the environment while under a test environment. However, once taken to the street the vehicle would start expelling all the pollution into the environment. After first being confronted by the emissions' officials, Volkswagen denied all accusations and said the car used for the testing had a flaw.
</p>
<p>
After having heard this, the officials believed Volkswagen and went ahead and tested a different car. The officials believed Volkswagen and truly hoped for the car to have been defective. Unfortunately, to the officials' surprise, the car used for the test was not defective. The real problem, they realized, was Volkswagen manufacturing cars unethically.
</p>
<p>
Once the emissions officials realized what Volkswagen was doing, the officials decided to take on the mission of uncovering the truth and letting the world know what Volkswagen was doing. How Volkswagen was cheating its way to the top while lying to millions of people and selling them the "ideal" product.
</p>
<p>
Volkswagen after seeing itself in a troubled position, it tried to come up with a different solution for the defeat device. To turn the defeat device off once the steering wheel of the car was turned. Which the solution made no sense whatsoever, it was like they had changed the previous defeat device with almost identical. It should have been obvious to Volkswagen that once the car was tested on the road it would have had
</p>
<p>
It took months of work for the officials to gather enough evidence to sustain in a case. They had to press hard all of the high executive officials at Volkswagen to admit the truth of what was going on. The officials requested meetings with Volkswagen executives for months and kept getting rejected one time after another. Until the emissions officials were able to get court orders to talk with the executives.
</p>
<p>
All of the executives knew about the defeat device and all of them agreed to the use of it. A long string of emails were found between executives discussing whether or not they should use the defeat device. They all agreed to the use of it. Some executives admitted their guilt, blamed others or said they had no idea something like that could be going on in the company.
</p>
<p>
As a matter of fact, most of the executives were blaming the engineers saying they had built a defeat device without the company's approval. That is a lie because nothing can be built at Volkswagen without the approval of the executives. The engineers were in agreement with the executives.
</p>
<p>
After months of interviewing and talking with everyone they could at Volkswagen, the officials gathered enough information to take the case to court and accused Volkswagen of using defeat devices. Volkswagen was prosecuted and in an agreement to buy back all Volkswagen (of that model) that people had purchased. Which they did if they wanted to stay in business.
</p>
<p>
Besides prosecuting Volkswagen, officials started investigating other car companies like Mercedes and BMW because their cars were emitting more polluting gases to the environment than the companies said it would.
